# YT-URL-Extractor
A Tampermonkey (and other *monkey) script to extract YT ID(s) from most YT pages with a single click

## What is this thing?
I wanted an easy one click solution to grab every YouTube ID from a page, then give me a neat list without duplicates ready for use elsewhere. I also fancied brushing up on my Tampermonkey/Javascript skills so though I would give it a go. I set to work throwing a solution together and ended up with this, it's a fairly neat solution that adds a discrete ðŸ“‹ button at the top of most pages, clicking it will either copy the current URL if you are watching a video or short, or on a playlist style page you'll get every a list of every URL on the page.

## Features
- Quick and easy to use
- Should work with most &ast;monkey variants: Tested/Developed with Chrome Tampermonkey v4.18.1, Also tested on Firefox Greasemonkey 4.11 (from 2021)
- Auto updates if your &ast;monkey variant supports it

## Sounds great, how do I use it?
- The easiest way to install this is to click this link:  
[:floppy_disk: YT-URL-Extractor.user.js](https://github.com/NebularNerd/YT-URL-Extractor/raw/main/YT-URL-Extractor.user.js)  
most &ast;monkey's auto install features will then take care of things, this also can be used to manually trigger an update.
- **OR**, view the [YT-URL-Extractor.user.js](/YT-URL-Extractor.user.js) and then click the `RAW` button, if you wish to check out the code first.
- **OR**, Download or Copy/Paste the [YT-URL-Extractor.user.js](/YT-URL-Extractor.user.js) into your &ast;monkey, save and activate.  
 
Next time you vist a supported page (you may need to refresh if you are already on a YT page) you will see a small clipboard icon ðŸ“‹ next to the mic icon at the top of the page.

Give that a click and a banner will briefly flash to let you know it's done it job.

Paste your output wherever you need it, depending on the page there will be two outcomes:
- On a single video or short page you'll get just the URL from the video you are watching in this style [https://youtu.be/8jMPgvaOXH8](https://youtu.be/8jMPgvaOXH8), I know there is the share button, this saves a couple of clicks.
- On a playlist page or where multiple videos are diplayed you'll get a nice list like this:

## Limitations
If you are on a channels homepage and they have some sort of carousel/spinner thing, you'll only get the ID's for the items you can see, the others are not generated/rendered until you bring them into view. I decided to leave it there after coding it but it's not much use on that page.

## To-do
- [ ] Code optimisation: Code is fast enough but I'm sure there are a couple of things that could be better
- [ ] Add clipboard button to individual videos links, quickly grab individual URLs as well as whole page
- [x] Add auto update
